# Distance of multidimensional points
This application was created for the test homework of Gravity R&D.

## Features
The application can determine the closest distance of 2 points in any dimension.

## Usage
### Input
Input should be a filepath that file contains floating point numbers separated by tabulator. One line must represent one point, involving its coordinates.

### Output
Output will give you 2 lines. You will find the number of the line of closest point and the coordinates of these points.

##Running time
The asymptotic running time of this application is O(2N^2)
